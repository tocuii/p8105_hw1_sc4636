# Homework 1

## Problem 1

**Create a data frame**

``` r
problem1_df = tibble(
  vec_rnorm = rnorm(8),
  vec_logical = c(vec_rnorm > 0),
  vec_char = c("sky", "fire", "tomato", "grass", "ocean", "jeans", "cucumber", "strawberry"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("blue", "red", "red", "green", "blue", "blue", "green", "red"))
)
```

**Take the mean**

The variable `vec_rnorm` has a mean of `-0.7247399`, and the variable
`vec_logical` has a mean of `0.125`. Mean values can be taken directly
from variables classified as *numeric* or *logical*.

Whereas, the mean for variable `vec_char` is `NA` and for `vec_factor`
is `NA`. `mean()` cannot take means from variables classified as
*character* or *factor*.

**Convert types of variables**

The below chunk converts logical, character and factor variables in the
above data frame to numeric data type.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, vec_logical))
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, vec_char))
as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor))
```

When converting logical variables to numeric ones, `TRUE` logical
variable takes numeric value of `1` while `FALSE` takes value of `0`.
When taking the mean value of logical variables, R automatically
converts logical variables to numeric ones.

When converting character variables to numeric ones, in this case, a
warning message `NAs introduced by coercion` popped. The character
variables in this data frame are consisted of letters which would induce
NA value when converted to numeric data type. Thus, when taking the mean
value for character value in this data frame, the result shows `NA`.

When converting factor variables to numeric ones, R converts different
factor levels in alphabetical order to match numeric variables if not
specified. For example, factor level blue takes the value of 1, green
takes 2, and red takes 3. However, the corresponding number has no
meaning.

``` r
vec_logical_numeric = as.numeric(pull(problem1_df, vec_logical)) * pull(problem1_df, vec_rnorm)
vec_logical_factor = as.factor(pull(problem1_df, vec_logical)) * pull(problem1_df, vec_rnorm)
```

    ## Warning in Ops.factor(as.factor(pull(problem1_df, vec_logical)),
    ## pull(problem1_df, : '*' not meaningful for factors

``` r
vec_logical_factor_numeric = as.numeric(vec_logical_factor) * pull(problem1_df, vec_rnorm)
```

## Problem 2

**Create a data frame**

``` r
problem2_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(500),
  y = rnorm(500),
  vec_logical = c(x + y > 1),
  vec_numeric = as.numeric(vec_logical),
  vec_factor = as.factor(vec_logical)
)
```

  - The above dataset is comprised of 500 rows and 5 columns.

  - Variable `x` has a mean of 0.0070545, a median of -0.0229655, and a
    standard deviation of 0.9730108.

  - The proportion of cases for which `x + y > 1` equals to 0.238.

**Making scatterplots**

``` r
# Logical variable
ggplot(problem2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = vec_logical)) +
  geom_point() + labs(color = "Logical variable")
```

![](p8105_hw1_sc4636_files/figure-gfm/scatterplots%20of%20y%20vs%20x-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("plot1_logical_variable.png")
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

``` r
# Numeric variable
ggplot(problem2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = vec_numeric)) +
  geom_point() + labs(color = "Numeric variable")
```

![](p8105_hw1_sc4636_files/figure-gfm/scatterplots%20of%20y%20vs%20x-2.png)<!-- -->

``` r
# Factor variable
ggplot(problem2_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color = vec_factor)) +
  geom_point() + labs(color = "Factor variable")
```

These three plots show consistent distribution according to color. In
the first and third plots, for dots in orange, `x + y ≤ 1`. For dots in
blue, `x + y > 1`. In the second plot, `x + y > 1` for light blue dots
while `x + y ≤ 1` for dark blue dots.
